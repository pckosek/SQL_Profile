[Server 1](./server_01) is a basic form interface that triggers an action in the database

[Server 2](./server_02) allows the user to enter a custom nickname that will be stored in the database (everyone is the same user, though!)

[Server 3](./server_03) demonstrates extensibility of usernames - all users still use the same id, but the id is presented as a variable (not hard coded)

[Server 4](./server_04) converts Server 3 into a POST request

[Server 5](./server_05) ask for a profile number in the form; allows the user to set a nickname for a particular profile number
